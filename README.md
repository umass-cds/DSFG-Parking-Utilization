# DSFG-Parking-Utilization
## Quantifying Utilization of Public Parking for Amherst, MA
Automated Assessment of Public Parking Utilization

## Project Description
In May 2018, the Center for Data Science (CDS), a research center within the College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, launched a “Data Science for Common Good” (DS4Good) initiative. Under the DS4Good banner, a collection of summer-length projects have been created. Each DS4Good project brings together a team of CICS graduate students and faculty, and supports them as they develop and apply data science tools and methods in ways that may benefit a local non-profit, community organization, or government.
