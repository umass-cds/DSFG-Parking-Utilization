# DSFG-Parking-Utilization
## Data Science For Common Good
In May 2018, the Center for Data Science (CDS), a research center within the College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, launched a “Data Science for Common Good” (DS4Good) initiative. Under the DS4Good banner, a collection of summer-length projects have been created. Each DS4Good project brings together a team of CICS graduate students and faculty, and supports them as they develop and apply data science tools and methods in ways that may benefit a local non-profit, community organization, or government.

## Quantifying Utilization of Public Parking for Amherst, MA
This project investigated parking utilization in downtown Amherst, Massachusetts. Three methods were used to determine parking utilization: analyzing ParkMobile data, crowdsourcing on Mechanical Turk, and creating a machine learning Neural Network model on images from the Main Street Parking Lot.

The deliverable of the project was an [interactive visualization](https://umass-cds.github.io/DSFG-Parking-Utilization/) of the parking utilization of a Main Street parking lot.
